      I build reliable and automated web scraping solutions to extract valuable
      data from websites efficiently and ethically. Using Python libraries such
      as BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Selenium, I can transform unstructured web
      content into well-organized datasets for analysis or integration.

      <li>✔ Exporting data to formats such as CSV, Excel, or databases</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead mb-4">
      Whether it’s for price monitoring, market research, or data aggregation, I
      ensure your scraping tools are fast, accurate, and scalable — helping you
      make data-driven decisions with ease.
