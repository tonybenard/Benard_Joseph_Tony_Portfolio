      I help individuals and businesses unlock insights from their data through
      advanced analytics and visualization. Using Python, pandas, and Power BI,
      I clean, analyze, and visualize datasets to uncover trends, measure
      performance, and guide strategic decisions.
    </p>
    <p class="lead mb-4">My work typically covers:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled text-start d-inline-block">
      <li>✔ Data cleaning and preprocessing</li>
      <li>✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li>
      <li>✔ Building dashboards and visual reports</li>
      <li>✔ Statistical analysis and trend forecasting</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead mb-4">
      My goal is to make data simple, visual, and actionable — empowering you to
      understand patterns, optimize operations, and achieve measurable growth.
